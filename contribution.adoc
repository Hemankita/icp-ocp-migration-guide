# Contributing to ICP to Openshift Migration Guide

To contribute to Openshift guide, there are multiple ways: report bugs and improvement suggestions, improve documentation, and contribute to it.

## Bug reports and documentation changes

If you would like to contribute to the project, you can do it in the form of encountered bug reports, this can be done through the use of the repository's [**Issues**](#) list.

Before opening a new issue, please reference the existing list to make sure a similar or duplicate item does not already exist.  Otherwise, please be as explicit as possible when creating the new item and be sure to include the following:

- **Bug reports**
  - URL to existing incorrect or incomplete documentation (either in the project's GitHub repo or external documentation)
  - Updates required to correct current inconsistency
  - If possible, a link to a project fork, sample, or workflow to expose the gap in documentation.

The more explicit and thorough you are in opening GitHub Issues, the more efficient your interaction with the maintainers will be.

## Code contributions

We request the contributions to follow the guidelines below.  If you are new to contribution and would like some more pointers or guidance, you may want to check out [**Your First PR**](http://yourfirstpr.github.io/) and [**First Timers Only**](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/).  These are a few projects that help on-board new contributors to the overall process.

### Pull Requests best practices

- One bug fix / documentation update per pull request
  - Always pull the latest changes from upstream and rebase before creating any pull request.

### Steps to contribute

1. Fork the desired repo in github.

2. Clone your repo to your local computer.

3. Add the upstream repository

Note: Guide for step 1-3 here: [forking a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

4. Create new development branch off the targeted upstream branch.  This will often be `master`.

```
git checkout -b <my-feature-branch> master
```

5. Make the necessary changes in the documentation.

6. Fetch latest upstream changes (in case other changes had been delivered upstream while you were updating the docs).

```
git fetch upstream
```

7. Rebase to the latest upstream changes, resolving any conflicts. This will 'replay' your local commits, one by one, after the changes delivered upstream while you were locally developing, letting you manually resolve any conflict.

```
git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master
git rebase
```

8. Push the changes to your repository

```
git push origin <my-feature-branch>
```

9. Create a pull request against the same targeted upstream branch.

[Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

Once the pull request has been reviewed, accepted and merged into the main github repository, you should synchronise your remote and local forked github repository `master` branch with the upstream master branch. To do so:

10. Pull to your local forked repository the latest changes upstream (that is, the pull request).

```
git pull upstream master
```

11. Push those latest upstream changes pulled locally to your remote forked repository.

```
git push origin master
```

### What happens next?

- All pull requests will be automatically built and tested by travis-ci.
  - When in use, all travis-ci tests must pass completely before any further review or discussion takes place.
- The repository maintainer will then inspect the commit and, if accepted, will pull the changes into the upstream branch.
- Should a maintainer or reviewer ask for changes to be made to the pull request, these can be made locally and pushed to your forked repository and branch.
- Commits passing this stage will make it into the documentation.
