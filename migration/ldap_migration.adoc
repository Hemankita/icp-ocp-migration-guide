==== User Authentication migration – LDAP
:imagesdir: ../media

Kubernetes does not have users; it’s up to the Kubernetes distribution to
provide an authentication endpoint that performs user authentication and
identity mapping to either a User or a Group. Kubernetes does have roles and
cluster roles, which are used to group permissions, and rolebindings and
clusterrolebindings, which are used to assign permissions to particular users or
groups.

For more information about how authentication is implemented in Kubernetes, see:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/

In ICP, the internal auth-idp component is used as an OIDC provider that
authenticates users. This component can be configured from the UI and will
connect to LDAP on behalf of the cluster to authenticate users. The ``Teams''
concept is used to group together users or groups from LDAP into logical groups
and is managed by the auth-idp component and persisted in mongodb.

Openshift 3.11 has a similar component embedded in the API server that performs
authentication on behalf of the cluster. However, it does not have a UI to
configure LDAP, so it takes some work during installation or after installation
to configure LDAP.

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/configuring_authentication.html#LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider

Openshift 4.x uses a separate operator to perform authentication, and another
operator manages that operator and its configuration using a
CustomResourceDefinition to configure LDAP and other identity providers.

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/authentication/identity_providers/configuring-ldap-identity-provider.html

In our migration scenario, we specifically we looked at migrating an existing
ICP LDAP connection to Openshift 3.11.

Our LDAP server had the following contents:

....
dn: dc=internal-network,dc=local
dc: internal-network
objectClass: top
objectClass: domain

dn: cn=ldapadm,dc=internal-network,dc=local
objectClass: organizationalRole
cn: ldapadm

dn: ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: People

dn: ou=Group,dc=internal-network,dc=local
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: Group

dn: cn=binduser,dc=internal-network,dc=local
cn: binduser
objectClass: organizationalRole
objectClass: top
objectClass: simpleSecurityObject

dn: cn=user1,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local
cn: user1
objectClass: person
objectClass: simpleSecurityObject
objectClass: uidObject
objectClass: top
sn: one
uid: user1

dn: cn=dev1,ou=Group,dc=internal-network,dc=local
cn: dev1
objectClass: groupOfUniqueNames
objectClass: top
uniqueMember: cn=user1,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local
uniqueMember: cn=user2,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local

dn: cn=user2,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local
cn: user2
objectClass: person
objectClass: simpleSecurityObject
objectClass: uidObject
objectClass: top
sn: user two
uid: user2

dn: cn=clusteradmin,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local
cn: clusteradmin
objectClass: person
objectClass: simpleSecurityObject
objectClass: uidObject
objectClass: top
sn: cluster admin
uid: clusteradmin

dn: cn=admin,ou=Group,dc=internal-network,dc=local
cn: admin
objectClass: groupOfUniqueNames
objectClass: top
uniqueMember: cn=clusteradmin,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local

dn: cn=dev2,ou=Group,dc=internal-network,dc=local
cn: dev2
objectClass: groupOfUniqueNames
objectClass: top
uniqueMember: cn=user3,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local
uniqueMember: cn=user4,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local

dn: cn=user3,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local
cn: user3
objectClass: person
objectClass: simpleSecurityObject
objectClass: uidObject
objectClass: top
sn: three
uid: user3

dn: cn=user4,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local
cn: user4
objectClass: person
objectClass: simpleSecurityObject
objectClass: uidObject
objectClass: top
sn: four
uid: user4
....

The ICP configuration appeared as follows:

ifdef::env-github[]
image::image1.png[LDAP settings in ICP]
endif::[]

ifndef::env-github[]
image::image1.png[LDAP settings in ICP]
endif::[]

The matching Openshift configuration was configured under identityProviders on
each master host in /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml. Once this was
configured we restarted docker on each master host to restart the API server.
The configuration is as follows:

....
identityProviders:
  - name: "rhos-ldap"
    challenge: true
    login: true
    mappingMethod: claim
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider
      attributes:
        id:
        - dn
        email:
        - mail
        name:
        - cn
        preferredUsername:
        - uid
      bindDN: "cn=binduser,dc=internal-network,dc=local"
      bindPassword: "Letmein"
      insecure: true
      url: "ldap://192.168.100.4:389/dc=internal-network,dc=local?uid?sub?(objectclass=person)"
....

Pay particular interest to the url. The format of the URL is

....
ldap://host:port/basedn?attribute?scope?filter
....

We have translated this from the ICP configuration, where ``attribute'' and
``filter'' are built from the ``User filter'' in the ICP configuration. The
query it uses is:

....
(&(attribute=%v)(filter))
....

Openshift has explicit ``user'' and ``group'' resources which the API server
manages. You can list them using the familiar ``oc get users'' and ``oc get
groups'' commands as well as create additional ones.

As Openshift is a developer platform, the default mappingMethod ``claim'' allows
anybody that successfully authenticates access to the platform to login and
create projects. When authentication is successful, the platform will create a
``user'' resource automatically. The ICP model denies access to any users in
LDAP that are not part of a team. To match the ICP model and deny access to
anybody not explicitly added to Openshift there are two options:

* use the mappingMethod ``lookup''. However this requires additional overhead as
the administrator must individually create users in the Openshift platform
before they are given access to log in to Openshift.
+
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/configuring_authentication.html#LookupMappingMethod
+
In our case, we created a user for user1, created an identity for it in ldap,
and then mapped them together:
+
....
$ oc create user user1
user.user.openshift.io/user1 created

$ oc create identity rhos-ldap:cn=user1,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local
identity.user.openshift.io/rhos-ldap:cn=user1,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local created

$ oc create useridentitymapping rhos-ldap:cn=user1,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local user1
useridentitymapping.user.openshift.io/rhos-ldap:cn=user1,ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local created
....
* Leave the default mappingMethod ``claim'' but deny access to create new
projects in Openshift. By default the ``system:authenticated'' group
(i.e. anybody in LDAP) is given the ``self-provisioner'' cluster-role, which
allows project creation. Removing the role removes the overhead of having to
create new users as they log in, but also prevents authenticated users from
consuming resources in the platform without cluster administrator action. See:
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/managing_projects.html#disabling-self-provisioning
+
....
$ oc patch clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -p '{ "metadata": { "annotations": { "rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate": "false" } } }'
$ oc patch clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -p '{"subjects": null}'
....
* We think this matches ICP the closest, but allowing users to create projects
on their own has some advantages in developer scenarios. Using the above policy
makes sense in production clusters but can be relaxed in development/test
clusters.

==== Group migration – LDAP

Note that the Openshift api server does not query groups from LDAP; group
definitions must be synced manually. The documentation around this is here:
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/syncing_groups_with_ldap.html

In our scenario we had users in the tree under ou=People, and groups under
ou=Group. Three groups were created (dev1, dev2, and admins). We used the
following rfc2307 LDAP sync config:

....
kind: LDAPSyncConfig
apiVersion: v1
url: ldap://192.168.100.4:389/dc=internal-network,dc=local
bindDN: "cn=binduser,dc=internal-network,dc=local"
bindPassword: "Letmein"
insecure: true
rfc2307:
    groupsQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=Group,dc=internal-network,dc=local"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
        pageSize: 0
        filter: "(objectclass=groupOfUniqueNames)"
    groupUIDAttribute: dn
    groupNameAttributes: [ cn ]
    groupMembershipAttributes: [ uniqueMember ]
    usersQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=People,dc=internal-network,dc=local"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
        pageSize: 0
    userUIDAttribute: dn
    userNameAttributes: [ uid ]
    tolerateMemberNotFoundErrors: false
    tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors: false
....

Observe how this maps to the configuration in ICP; the groups are of object
class ``groupOfUniqueNames'' and the ``uniqueMember'' attribute contains the
members of the group which will be in turn queried.

Running this command will add some Openshift ``Group'' resources that can be
assigned roles.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc adm groups sync --sync-config=rfc2307_config.yaml  --confirm
group/dev1
group/admin
group/dev2
----

The result is three groups, with the user mappings as shown.

....
$ oc get groups
NAME      USERS
admin     clusteradmin
dev1      user1, user2
dev2      user3, user4
....

As this is a manual process that produces static user/group mappings, it may be
required to run this on a schedule that updates and prunes groups in an ongoing
basis.

One additional implementation note is that Openshift issues Opaque tokens; since
the authentication module is embedded in the API server it is able to validate
the tokens internally. In ICP, the authentication token issued by the auth
service is a signed JWT that contains an embedded list of groups that Kubernetes
uses to validate permissions. In the next session when we discuss RBAC, we can
see how rolebindings and clusterrolebindings are bound to these groups.
