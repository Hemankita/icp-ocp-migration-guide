==== Using a `+nonroot+` SecurityContextConstraint

In cases where existing shared storage is attached to the container as a volume,
and the container must write to the filesystem as a particular uid, we can run
the pod under a service account, and assign the "nonroot" scc to the service
account. This relaxes the restrictions on the uid and allows the container
process to be executed as some specific UID, but not root. This is essentially
equivalent to ICPâ€™s ``ibm-restricted-psp" security policy. For example, in our
above example our MySQL container runs as uid 5984, but Openshift blocks the
execution since the uid is not within the allowed range for''restricted" SCC, so
we created a service account ``inventory-mysql'' for the pod, allow it to use
the ``nonroot'' SCC and set the deployment to run as this service account.

....
$ oc create serviceaccount inventory-mysql
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user nonroot -z inventory-mysql
$ oc patch deploy/inventory-mysql --patch \
     '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccountName":"inventory-myql"}}}}}'
....

==== Using `+anyuid+` SeucirtyContextConstraint

In cases where running as the root user is absolutely necessary, we can leverage
a serviceaccount and assign the "anyuid" SCC to allow the container to run as
root. For example, in our BlueCompute reference application, couchdb only works
when it runs as root due to the way it tries to change ownership of the data
directories. We will allow couchdb to run as root user:

Steps in ICP:

....
$ kubectl ceate serviceaccount -n bluecompute customer-couchdb
$ kubectl create role psp-ibm-anyuid-psp -n bluecompute --verb=use \
     --resource=podsecuritypolicy --resource-name=ibm-anyuid-psp
$ kubectl create rolebinding couchdb-ibm-anyuid-psp -n bluecompute \
     --role=psp-ibm-anyuid-psp --serviceaccount=bluecompute:customer-couchdb
....

Now we add the serviceaccount to the podspec in the statefulset.

....
$ kubectl patch deploy/couchdb --patch \
     '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccountName":"customer-couchdb"}}}}}'
....

Similarly, in Openshift:

....
$ oc create serviceaccount -n bluecompute customer-couchdb
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z customer-couchdb
$ oc patch deploy/couchdb --patch \
     '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccountName":"customer-couchdb"}}}}}'
....
